Had difficulties finding the right pathway to importing images, noticed you could rightclick on the image and copy relative path.
For the footer I used the same code that we used for the Running project.
I spent a few hours trying to figure out how to work the columns - realised you could add "empty" divs to create space. 
half of my readme disapeared?
spent a long time trying to fix the images with grid layout, decided that it wasnt necessary because i have 4 videos in the next section
had big problems trying to make sizing of the videos responsive, so i contacted student support 
i was instructed to learn how to use flex box for that row, and then upon working with responsivity made the whole "guide" section with flex box instead, action instead got help with a line of code to get started and then i watched videos/pages on how to use it
had issues with justify-content where the distance between wasnt the same for different rows, realised i had to make the text-elements on each row the same width
having problems with creating a sticky header, doesent seem to work
started cleaning up my code and making ids and classes make more sense to others
when making media queries i realised i hadnt closed the element properly which caused a lot of confusion when i worked on responsivness 
figuring out how to align text with the outer edge of the video box
