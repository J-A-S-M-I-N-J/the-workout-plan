# The Workout Plan

**The Workout Plan** is a web-page which aims to inspire and help people out with their exercising and diet. It consists of 3 sections - The Peptalk, The Guide and The Diet. 

The Peptalk is a section with information around health benefits and what we offer, together with a short list of things necessary to get started. 
The Guide is a section with a workout regimen and relevant video-content for particular muscle groups. 
The Diet-section gives information about the importance of eating right and has a form you can fill out to receive custom meal-prep that fits your lifestyle.

## Features

### Navigation

- The top of the page has a navigation menu. The main header links to the top of the page.
- It has three menu-items - The Peptalk, The Guide and The Diet. These are anchor-links and will send you to the appropriate section. 
- The menu is a dull orange color which gives great contrast to the black text-color and fits in with the other soft dull color-pallettes spaning the whole page. 
- The menu is very simple and obvious to use.

## Bugs

- I spent a few hours trying to figure out how to work the columns - realised you could add "empty" divs to create space. 
spent a long time trying to fix the images with grid layout, decided that it wasnt necessary because i have 4 videos in the next section
had big problems trying to make sizing of the videos responsive, so i contacted student support 
i was instructed to learn how to use flex box for that row, and then upon working with responsivity made the whole "guide" section with flex box instead, action instead got help with a line of code to get started and then i watched videos/pages on how to use it
had issues with justify-content where the distance between wasnt the same for different rows, realised i had to make the text-elements on each row the same width
having problems with creating a sticky header, doesent seem to work
Had difficulties finding the right pathway to importing images, noticed you could rightclick on the image and copy relative path.
figuring out how to align text with the outer edge of the video box

copy relative path for /imgs
started cleaning up my code and making ids and classes make more sense to others
